Replicant is an automation script to creates an identical copy of your machine on a fresh (Xubuntu) install.

It has been optimized for XFCE settings, but it is certainly not limited to this distro.

Some sample defaults have been left to illustrate how to implement the basic Ansible tasks that you will need. Customize and conquer!
