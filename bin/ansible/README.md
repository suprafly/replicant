# Replicant Ansible Playbook

## playbook.yml

This is the file that kicks off the whole system replication process. You should not need to modify it.

## roles/replicant/tasks

This dir contains all of the tasks which are run by Replicant. They are defined in `roles/replicant/tasks/main.yml`,
so if you add your own make sure to include it there.
